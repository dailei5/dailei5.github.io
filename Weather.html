		<p> The Weather Vault ® website is designed for people moving to another city in the US and concerned about change of climate.</p>
		<p>The User enters a desired climate into the Weather Vault ®. The WeatherVault and the
        UserVault entities are queried, then retrieve and display a list of all matching cities and profiles
        of certified guides are displayed. After the User selects a guide the User receives the guide’s
        contact information (email, first name, last name).
        Becoming a Weather Vault ® guide is a process initiated by a User by selecting the “become a
        Weather Vault ® guide” option on the website. Upon receipt of a request the information is
        reviewed and if granted, the “isGuide” attribute is switched to true..
        Weather Vault ® currently has 25,000 daily active users and updates its weather and User’s
        locations daily. We have recently announced establishing an IPO and are expecting an increase
        in our user-base to about 1,000,000 daily users. It is expected that our heads of software design
        will be rebuilding and reorganizing the database system to handle the projected load. </p>
